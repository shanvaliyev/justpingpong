# justpingpong

An arcade table-tennis game built with React, TanStack Router, and Three.js.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **Cloudflare D1** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Play the local prototype

Run `pnpm dev:web` and open the web app. The home page is a first-person table-tennis practice game; it needs no API server, database, account, or environment variables.

- Move the mouse or drag one finger to position the floating paddle. Flick upward to swing forward; a stationary paddle can block.
- Keyboard: arrow keys / WASD to move, Space to swing, P to pause.
- A friendly AI returns the ball. Misses automatically feed a new ball. Restart clears the current rally, but keeps the session best until the page reloads.
- Physics run at 120 Hz with gravity, swept paddle/net contacts, and table bounces. Returns have assisted aiming; this is an arcade prototype, without spin, regulation scoring, or multiplayer. The racket's pose (handle angle, forehand/backhand turn, swing follow-through, contact recoil) is visual only, not a spin control.
- A new game randomly selects the daytime sakura court, golden-hour seaside, or blue-hour Tokyo rooftop. Manual restart picks again (repeats are possible); misses and pause/resume keep the current scene.
- The court backgrounds are generated illustrations; the table, ball, paddles, and shadows render in Three.js.

Check the web build and types with `pnpm --filter web check-types`.

## Database Setup

This project uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Drizzle ORM.

Runtime database access uses the Cloudflare `DB` binding from `packages/infra/alchemy.run.ts`. If a local `DATABASE_URL` is present, it is only for database tooling.

Alchemy provisions the D1 database and applies migrations during `deploy`.

1. Generate migration files:

```bash
pnpm run db:generate
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@justpingpong/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `pnpm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

For Cloudflare, Alchemy loads and validates deployment inputs with `varlock/auto-load` in its Node/Bun deployment process. Worker code reads native bindings; web clients use the framework's public env API through `src/env.public.ts` where needed. Alchemy supplies resource URLs and managed database credentials. In-Worker Varlock protections are deferred until an official Alchemy integration is available; see [the non-Wrangler deployment guidance](https://varlock.dev/integrations/cloudflare/#non-wrangler-deploy-tools-alchemy-sst-pulumi).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: web on Cloudflare + server on Cloudflare
- Configure provider accounts: `cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy profile edit`
- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy

`alchemy profile edit` stores the selected Axiom, Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy deploy --stage production
```

### Production origins

- Required after the first deploy: set `CORS_ORIGIN` in `apps/server/.env` to the exact deployed web origin, such as `https://app.example.com`, then deploy the server again.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `pnpm run check`
